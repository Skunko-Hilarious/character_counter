# character_counter
# A program that takes text files, counts how many times a character is used in the document, and exports it into a CSV file.


# Setup and variables
import csv

# In order to adapt this program for any text file you have, enter the file path and name of the document you want to scan
f = open("C:/file.txt","r")
text = f.read()
length = len(text)
letters = {}

# Counting uses and creating diary entries
for count in range(0, length):
    char = text[count]
    char = char.upper()
    if char not in letters:
        letters[char] = 0
        letters[char] = letters[char] + 1
    else:
        currentNum = letters[char] + 1
        letters[char] = letters[char] + 1
for i in letters:
    print(i, letters[i])
f.close()

# Creating csv file
